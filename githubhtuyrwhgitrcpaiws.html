        <p> my name is tyler i have a buzz cut I’m someone with a pretty diverse range of interests. When it comes to music, 
            I’m all about artists who push boundaries and bring something unique to the table. I like with Tyler, The Creator, Dominic Fike, Frank Ocean, 
            Childish Gambino, Kanye, Kendrick Lamar, and LUCKI. Each of them has a distinct sound and style that I connect with, whether it’s experimental 
            beats or thought-provoking lyrics. Outside of music, I’m really into sports, especially rugby. I love the strategy, intensity, and teamwork 
            involved in the game. And of course, I’m a huge fan of food—I’m always down to try something new or enjoy some comfort food. Life’s all about
             experiencing the things I love, whether it’s through music, sports, or a good meal.
